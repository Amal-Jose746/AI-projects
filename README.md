Enterprise Chat Assistant for FCD & NCR Analysis – Version 2
This repository contains a conversational AI application designed to assist with querying and analyzing Field Change Documents (FCD) and Non-Conformance Reports (NCR) using natural language. The assistant interprets user queries and returns precise, structured results or statistics, depending on the request.

The application is built using Python, Pandas, LangChain, and Streamlit, with backend support from an NVIDIA LLM, and provides retrieval-augmented logic for querying engineering document workflows and delay records.

About the Application
This project enables engineering teams and project stakeholders to ask detailed questions about project documents — such as how many FCDs are approved, which NCRs are delayed, or the average time taken for document approvals — all through natural language.

The assistant supports a range of functionalities:

Text-based querying of FCDs and NCRs
Filters by status, user, delay, project, and document metadata
Aggregation metrics (count, ratio, average, percentage)
Simultaneous handling of queries involving both document types
Safe and structured Pandas code execution
It is optimized for both web-based interaction and local desktop use.

Core Logic and Functionality
The system works by performing three key steps:

1. Query Classification
Each user query is first categorized into one of the following:

count: Returns numeric metrics like counts, ratios, averages (query using, "how many", "count", "total number", "number of")
table: Lists documents filtered by project, stage, or delay (query using, "list", "display", "filter", "which", "entries", "table", "pending", "summarize", "overview", "highlights")
summary: Generates table of required field in suggested format in prompt (if document context is loaded)
chat: Fallback for general queries
2. Prompt Construction
The build_pandas_prompt() function generates a detailed prompt that instructs the LLM to return executable Pandas code only, based on:

Query intent
Targeted DataFrame (FCD or NCR)
Filtering conditions (status, delay, user, project)
Column selection rules
You can modify the logic, rules, or formatting of the generated code by editing the build_pandas_prompt() function if needed.

3. Code Execution
The generated Pandas code is executed within a controlled environment using a secure safe_execute_pandas_code() function. It validates, parses, and executes the code while safeguarding the data from unintended mutations.

Data Preparation & Updates
The app works with two Parquet files:

fcd_data.parquet
ncr_data.parquet
These files are refreshed daily using a Jupyter notebook.

Daily Data Update Workflow:
Open the file data_paraquet_former.ipynb from this repository.
Run all cells to extract and process the latest data.
This will generate two updated files:
C:\Temp\Py_Files_sid\fcd_data.parquet
C:\Temp\Py_Files_sid\ncr_data.parquet
Copy these files into your GitHub repository to update the deployed application with the latest data.
We can also automate this process to comit these files in github using github desktop and then change the path of batch file "run_data_parquet" which is currently set to "C:\Temp\Py_Files_sid", to the github desktop repository folder created. So every day it will get updated in morning and then will be commited to online github repo.

How to Launch the Application
Web Interface
You can access the hosted web version here:
🔗 https://ai-projects-lnt-digital.streamlit.app/ (for Memory Enabled Query)

These links launches the Streamlit-based Versions of the Retrieval-Augmented Chat Assistant.

Run Locally (Desktop Version)
To run the app locally on your desktop:

Navigate to the following path in your system: C:\Temp\Py_Files_sid
Open Command Prompt in that directory and execute:
python -m streamlit run streamlit_test_2.py
Replace streamlit_test_2.py with your specific script name if different.

This will open a local Streamlit session with full functionality.
